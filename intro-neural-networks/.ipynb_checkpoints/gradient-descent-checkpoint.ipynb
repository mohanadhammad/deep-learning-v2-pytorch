Instead, we need to use [dummy variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_(statistics)) to encode ```rank```, splitting the data into four new columns encoded with ones or zeros.

To compensate for this, you'd need to use a quite small learning rate. Instead, we can just divide by the number of records in our data, mm to take the average. This way, no matter how much data we use, our learning rates will typically be in the range of 0.01 to 0.001.
